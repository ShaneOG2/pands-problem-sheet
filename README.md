## Overview ##
This respository contains my work for the 8 Pand-Problems given for Programming and Scripting. I have outlined below ... 


### Problem 1 - Body Mass Index (BMI) ###
---
**Description** - Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person given their weight (kg) and height (cm). 

**How the program works** - 
1. The program begins by asking the user to input the weight (kg) and then height. 
2. Both inputs are stored as int variables, ***w_kg*** and ***h_cm*** respectively. 
3. The formala for BMI<sup>1</sup> is: **weight (kg) / (height (m))<sup>2</sup>**. This was calculated and stored as ***bmi***. 
4. Given the inputed height was in cm, ***h_cm*** was divided by 100 in the calculation of ***bmi*** to convert to m.
5. The round function<sup>2</sup> was used to round ***bmi*** to 2 decimal places. 
6. Next, I decided to add a bit more to the program and give the user an indication<sup>3</sup> whether the BMI they got was underweight, normal, overweight, obese or extremly obese.
7. This was acheived using if/else statements<sup>4</sup> and Comparison Operators<sup>5</sup>.
8. Finally, The BMI was printed<sup>6</sup> out along with the result indicator (i.e. underweight, normal, etc.)
