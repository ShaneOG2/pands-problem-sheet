### Problem 1 - Body Mass Index (BMI) ###
---
**Description** - Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) of a person given their weight (kg) and height (cm). 

**How the program works** - 
1. The program begins by asking the user to input the weight (kg). 
2. Then to input the person's height (cm). 
3. Both inputs are stored as int variables - ***w_kg*** and ***h_cm*** respectively. 
4. The formala for BMI is: <p>weight (kg) / (height (m))<sup>2}</sup></p>
